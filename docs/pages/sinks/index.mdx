# Sinks

Sinks in GlassGen are destinations where the generated data can be sent. Each sink type has its own configuration options and use cases.

## Available Sinks

- [CSV Sink](./csv) - Write data to CSV files
- [Kafka Sink](./kafka) - Send data to Kafka topics
- [Webhook Sink](./webhook) - Send data to HTTP endpoints
- [Yield Sink](./yield) - Get data as an iterator for in-memory processing
- [Custom Sink](./custom) - Create your own sink implementation

## Common Configuration

All sinks share a common configuration structure:

```json
{
  "sink": {
    "type": "sink_type",
    "params": {
      // sink-specific parameters
    }
  }
}
```

The `type` field specifies which sink to use, and the `params` object contains the sink-specific configuration options.

## Choosing a Sink

When choosing a sink, consider:

1. **Data Format**: Do you need JSON, CSV, or another format?
2. **Destination**: Where does the data need to go? (file system, message queue, HTTP endpoint)
3. **Performance**: What are your throughput requirements?
4. **Integration**: How will the data be consumed by downstream systems?

Select a sink from the list above to learn more about its specific configuration and use cases.
